# OctoFit Tracker

Repository scaffold for the OctoFit Tracker application.

Structure:

```
octofit-tracker/
├── backend/
│   ├── venv/                # Python virtual environment (created)
│   ├── requirements.txt     # Python requirements (created)
│   └── octofit_tracker/     # Django app package (scaffold)
└── frontend/                # React/frontend scaffold
```

Next steps: create the Django project in `backend/octofit_tracker` and the React app in `frontend`.
